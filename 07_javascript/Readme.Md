## 🗓️ Day 29 – Data Types in JavaScript
- **Primitive types:** Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt  
- **Reference types:** Array, Object, Function  
- Meaning:  
  - *Primitive*: holds single, immutable value  
  - *Reference*: holds data by reference (complex structures)

## 🗓️ Day 37 – Loops, Recursion & Introduction to Functions in JavaScript  

### 🔹 Key Learnings:
- **do...while Loop** → Ensures at least one iteration before the condition is checked.  
- **Recursion** → A function calling itself to solve repetitive or nested problems.  
- **Loop Control Statements** → Learned about `break` and `continue` for managing loop flow.  
- **Introduction to Functions** →  
  - What functions are and why they’re widely used in JavaScript.  
  - Basic understanding of **parameters** and **arguments**.  

### 💡 Takeaway:
Functions and recursion are the foundation of logic building in JavaScript.  
They help make code cleaner, modular, and reusable — strengthening problem-solving skills.

## 🗓️ Day 38 – Advanced JavaScript Functions  

### 🔹 Key Learnings:
- **Parameters in JS:**  
  - Required Parameters  
  - Destructured Parameters  
  - Default Parameters  
- **Arguments:**  
  - Positional Arguments  
  - Default Arguments  
  - Spread Arguments  

### 🔹 Function Types & Concepts:
- **Classic Function** – Traditional function declaration.  
- **Nested Functions** – Functions inside other functions.  
- **Scope Chain** – How JS searches variables through function scopes.  
- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** – Executes as soon as it’s defined.  
- **Arrow Function** – Concise syntax for writing functions.  
- **Higher-Order Functions** – Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.  
- **Callback Function** – Passed into another function to be executed later.  
- **First-Class Functions** – JS treats functions as variables (can be passed, returned, or stored).  

### 💡 Takeaway:
Functions are the *building blocks* of JavaScript logic — they bring structure, reusability, and interactivity.  
Mastering them is key to becoming a confident JS developer.

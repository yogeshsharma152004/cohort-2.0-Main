 Level 1 – Basic Function, Array & Object Code
Tasks (Easy)
1. Write a function `sayHello()` that prints `"Hello
JavaScript"`.
2. Create a function `add(a, b)` that returns their sum
and log the result.
3. Write a function with a default parameter `name =
"Guest"` that prints `"Hi <name>"`.
4. Use rest parameters to make a function that adds
unlimited numbers.
5. Create an IIFE that prints `"I run instantly!"`.
6. Make a nested function where the inner one prints a
variable from the outer one.
7. Create an array of 5 fruits. Add one at the end and
remove one from the beginning.
8. Use a `for` loop to print all elements of an array.
9. Create an object `person` with keys `name`, `age`,
and `city`, and print each key’s value.
10. Use `setTimeout()` to log `"Time’s up!"` after 2
seconds.



Level 2 – Functional Thinking & Logic Tasks
(Intermediate)
1. Write a higher-order function `runTwice(fn)` that
takes another function and executes it two times.
2. Create one pure function that always returns the
same output for a given input, and one impure
function using a global variable.
3. Write a function that uses object destructuring
inside parameters to extract and print `name` and
`age`.
4. Demonstrate the difference between normal
function and arrow function when used as object
methods (the `this` issue).
5. Given an array of numbers, use `map()` to create a
new array where each number is squared.
6. Use `filter()` to get only even numbers from an
array.
7. Use `reduce()` to find the total salary from an array
of numbers `[1000, 2000, 3000]`.
8. Create an array of names and use `some()` and
`every()` to test a condition (e.g., all names longer than
3 chars).
9. Create an object `user` and test the behavior of
`Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()` by
adding/changing keys.
10. Create a nested object (`user → address → city`) and
access the city name inside it.

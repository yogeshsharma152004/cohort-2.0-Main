## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ JavaScript Destructuring
- Learned how to extract values from objects and arrays easily.
- Helps in writing cleaner, shorter, and more readable code.
- Very commonly used in React props and state handling.

---

### 2️⃣ Module JavaScript (Import & Export)
- Understood why modular code is important in modern frontend development.
- Learned how JavaScript files communicate with each other using modules.

---

### 3️⃣ Default Export

## 🚀 Day 71– Tailwind CSS in React

Today I learned about **Tailwind CSS** and how it is used in **React applications** to build fast, clean, and scalable user interfaces.

---

## 📌 What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a **utility-first CSS framework** where we style elements using predefined utility classes directly in HTML or JSX instead of writing custom CSS repeatedly.

---

## ❓ Why Use Tailwind CSS?

- Faster UI development
- No need to write separate CSS files
- Consistent design system
- Easy responsiveness and customization
- Perfect fit for component-based frameworks like React

---

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

- How Tailwind CSS works internally
- Difference between traditional CSS and utility-first CSS
- Using Tailwind via CDN in normal HTML projects
- Installing and configuring Tailwind CSS in a React project
- How Tailwind classes are used inside JSX

---

## ⚛️ Tailwind in React

- In React, Tailwind is **installed**, not used via CDN
- Tailwind works seamlessly with JSX
- Styling stays close to the component logic
- Helps in building reusable and clean components

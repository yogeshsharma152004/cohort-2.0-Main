## 🗓️ Day 43 – Introduction to the DOM (Document Object Model)

### 📌 Overview
Learned how JavaScript connects with the webpage using the DOM structure.



### 🔹 The 4 Pillars of DOM (Short)

1. **Select Elements**  
   - `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`

2. **Update Content**  
   - `innerHTML`, `textContent`

3. **Style with JS**  
   - Using `.style` to change CSS

4. **Add Event Listeners**  
   - `addEventListener("click")`, `dblclick`, etc.



### 💡 Takeaway
A simple yet powerful introduction to how JavaScript makes webpages dynamic and interactive.

## 🗓️ Day 44 – Math.random(), DOM Projects & Logic Building

### 🔍 Key Learnings
- Understood how **`Math.random()`** works and why it generates values between 0 and 1  
- Used **`Math.floor()`** with random values for real-world outputs  
- Applied randomness inside DOM-based mini projects  
- Strengthened basics of:
  - Selecting elements  
  - Updating HTML & CSS using JS  
  - Adding event listeners  

### 🎨 Project 1: Random Color Generator
- Generated random **HEX colors** using JavaScript  
- Applied the colors dynamically using DOM manipulation  
- Great practice for combining logic + UI updates  

### 🏆 Project 2: IPL Winner Selector
- Stored team data using **arrays & objects**  
- Selected a random team using `Math.random()`  
- Displayed results on the page via DOM updates  
- Helped in improving problem-solving and logic-building skills  

### 💡 Takeaway
Hands-on DOM tasks made randomness easy to understand and boosted confidence in writing interactive JavaScript features.

## 📚 What I Learned

### 🔹 1. Creating Elements Dynamically
- Learned how to use `document.createElement()` to make new HTML elements completely through JavaScript.
- Used properties like `innerHTML`, `style`, and class manipulation.

### 🔹 2. Appending Elements to the DOM
- Used `appendChild()` to add newly created elements into a parent element or directly onto the page.
- Understood how the DOM tree updates when elements are added dynamically.

## 🧪 Tasks

### ✅ **Task 1: Random Box Generator**
- Created multiple boxes dynamically using JavaScript.
- Positioned them at random locations on the screen using `Math.random()` and CSS positioning.
- Great exercise for DOM creation + coordinates logic.

### ✅ **Task 2: Random Text Generator (Using Arrays)**
- Made an array of different texts.
- Generated random text and placed it at different random screen positions.
- Practiced combining arrays + DOM manipulation effectively.
